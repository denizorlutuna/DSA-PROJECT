# Menstrual Cycle And Netflix Viewing Habits Analysis

# Project Overwiev 
Since 2019, I've been recording my menstruation dates using the Apple Health app, and I also have access to my Netflix account data dating back to 2018. 
By using this information, I'll analyze how my menstrual cycle influences my Netflix viewing habits.
I aim to uncover patterns that reveal how hormonal changes impact entertainment consumption by examining trends in genre preferences and watch time. 

# Goals
- **Identify Behavioral Patterns**: Explore whether there is a correlation between my menstruation and genres of the content that I watch.
- **Analyze Correlations**: Utilize statistical techniques to measure relationships between my menstruation, genre preferences, and viewing duration.
- **Apply Data Science Skills**: Use statistical techniques learned in DSA210 course to analyze data effectively.
