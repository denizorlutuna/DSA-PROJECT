# Menstrual Cycle And Netflix Viewing Habits Analysis

# Project Overwiev 
Since 2019, I've been recording my menstruation dates using the Apple Health app, and I also have access to my Netflix account data dating back to 2018. By using this information, I'll analyze how my menstrual cycle influences my Netflix viewing habits. I aim to uncover patterns that reveal how hormonal changes impact entertainment consumption by examining trends in genre preferences and watch time.
