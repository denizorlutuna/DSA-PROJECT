# Menstrual Cycle And Netflix Viewing Habits Analysis

# Project Overwiev 
Since 2019, I've been recording my menstruation dates using the Apple Health app, and I also have access to my Netflix account data dating back to 2018. 
By using this information, I'll analyze how my menstrual cycle influences my Netflix viewing habits.
I aim to uncover patterns that reveal how hormonal changes impact entertainment consumption by examining trends in genre preferences and watch time. 

# Objectives
- **Identify Behavioral Patterns**: Explore whether there is a correlation between my menstruation and genres of the content that I watch.
- **Analyze Correlations**: Utilize statistical techniques to measure relationships between my menstruation, genre preferences, and viewing duration.
- **Apply Data Science Skills**: Use statistical techniques learned in DSA210 course to analyze data effectively.

# Motivation
During my menstruation period, I experience noticeable mood changes compared to other times, but I've never analyzed this shit objectively.
This project provides an opportunity to quantify these changes by examining my Netflix viewing history, focusing on genre preferences and watch duration during menstruation versus regular periods.
By comparing these patterns, I aim to determine whether my media consumption habits fluctuate in a measurable way. 
This analysis can allow me to validate my observations with data and understand how my menstruation period influences my entertainment choices.
Additionally, this project serves as a practical appplication of data science techniques, enabling me to use statistical analysis and visualization tools to explore real world behavioral data.
Through this study, I hope to gain more structured perpective on my viewing habits and mood variations that happens because of menstruation in an objective manner.
