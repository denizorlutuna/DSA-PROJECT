# DSA-PROJECT: Menstrual Cycle And Netflix Viewing Habits Analysis

# Project Overview 
Since 2019, I've been recording my menstruation dates using the Apple Health app, and I also have access to my Netflix account data dating back to 2018. 
By using this information, I'll analyze how my menstrual cycle influences my Netflix viewing habits.
I aim to uncover patterns that reveal how hormonal changes impact entertainment consumption by examining trends in genre preferences and watch time. 


# Motivation
During my menstruation period, I experience noticeable mood changes compared to other times, but I've never analyzed this shift objectively.
This project provides an opportunity to quantify these changes by examining my Netflix viewing history, focusing on genre preferences and watch duration during menstruation versus regular periods.
By comparing these patterns, I aim to determine whether my media consumption habits fluctuate in a measurable way. 
This analysis will allow me to validate my observations with data and understand how my menstruation period influences my entertainment choices.
Additionally, this project serves as a practical application of data science techniques, enabling me to use statistical analysis and visualization tools to explore real world behavioral data. 
Through this study, I hope to gain a more structured perspective on my viewing habits and mood variations caused by menstruation in an objective manner.


# Objectives
- **Identify Behavioral Patterns**: Explore whether there is a correlation between my menstruation and genres of the content that I watch.
  
- **Analyze Correlations**: Utilize statistical techniques to measure relationships between my menstruation, genre preferences, and viewing duration.
  
- **Apply Data Science Skills**: Use statistical techniques learned in DSA210 course to analyze data effectively.
  

# Hypothesis
The menstruation period influences viewing habits, including genre preferences and watch duration.


# Data Sources
- **Apple Health App**: Menstruation dates have been recorded since 2019, and I created a CSV file by using this information.
[menstruation_dates.csv.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19168553/menstruation_dates.csv.txt)

- **Netflix Viewing History**: This dataset is provided by Netflix and contains my viewing records since 2018.

- **Genre Information**: I'll add genre information to the Netflix Viewing History file using the data from the IMDb website.
  

# Analysis Plan
This study follows a structured approach, including data collection, processing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical testing to examine the impact of menstruation on Netflix viewing habits.

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
   -Standardize dates and add genre classifications using IMDb.
   -Handle missing or inconsistent values.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   -Analyze watch time and genre preferences.
   -Visualize trends using bar charts, heatmaps, and time-series plots.
   
3. **Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing**:
   -Perform correlation analysis between menstruation and viewing behavior.
   -Use statistical tests to measure differences.
   
4. **Interpretation and Conclusions**:
   -Identify patterns, discuss findings, and address limitations.


# Expected Outcomes
This study hypothesizes that the menstruation period has a measurable impact on viewing habits. 
Specifically, I expect to observe changes in genre preferences and watch duration during mentruation compared to regular periods.
Possible trends may include:
1) A shift toward specific genres (e.g., comfort shows, emotional dramas, or lighthearted content).
2) An increase or decrease in total watch time depending on mood fluctuations caused by menstruation.
 
By analyzing  these patterns, I aim to determine whether menstruation influences media consumption behaviors in a statistically significant way.
